This is a set of python scripts that we use to synchronize our ApplyWeb applications and inquiries to our Jenzabar CX database. 

External Python Dependencies:
-----------------------------
* win32 extensions (or pyodbc) - odbc connections
* paramiko - sftp
* httplib2 - interaction with the tracking database


Process Flow:
--------------------------------------------------------
1. Get a list of files on the remote server (ApplyWeb).
2. Loop through the list of files and determine if the file has already been downloaded/already exists in the data directory
3. If the file does not already exist, pull the data file from the server
4. Load the files into the temporary application section of the Informix database
	a. iterate through the files
