This is a set of python scripts that we use to synchronize our ApplyWeb applications and inquiries to our Jenzabar CX database. 

External Python Dependencies:
-----------------------------
* win32 extensions (or pyodbc) - odbc connections
* paramiko - sftp
* httplib2 - interaction with the tracking database


Process Flow:
--------------------------------------------------------
* Get a list of files on the remote server (ApplyWeb).
* Loop through the list of files and determine if the file has already been downloaded/already exists in the data directory
* If the file does not already exist, pull the data file from the server
* Load the files into the temporary application section of the database.
